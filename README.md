Computational Linguistics Independent Study, Spring 2014
========

For this independent study, we will follow (fairly closely) material in Chris Manning and Hinrich Schuetze's _Foundations of Statistical Natural Language Processing_.

We will cover:

* basic probability and information theory
* n-gram language modeling
* basic word-sense disambiguation
* Markov models for parts of speech
* parsing
* basic classification (k-nearest neighbors and decision trees)

I assume a background in programming Python at the Level of Ling 144/244.

The class will be basically lecture with some problem sets that we will discuss in class. There will be a final project/paper that will assume the bulk of the course grade.
